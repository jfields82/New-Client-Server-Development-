## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
#### I make sure to write the programs in a way thatâ€™s organized, structure so that it looks more clear and presentable. I also make sure to add comments in my programs telling them what each line code says. Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 

## What were the advantages of working in this way? 
#### The advantages of work in this way is that if I run the program and I find that there is an error I can easily read each line of code and also read the comments I left in the program. 

## How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? 
#### Another way I can use CRUD Python module is if I was hired as a software engineer and I had a project that was similar to the CRUD Python module I can use the code to help me finish the project.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
#### The way I approach a problem as a computer scientist is I usually take a little time to break down the problem in it basic elements. Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 

## How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
#### My approach to this project was to first write comments in the code. Take my time working through each line of code and instructions that were given to me. 

## What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 
#### I would first work on one store data at a time. Also get client feedback as well after I finished the database. This way I know what changes I need to make.
     
## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
#### What computer scientist do is that they are able to write programs applications in databases that can help any organization reach their goals. 

## How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? 
#### It would help by being able to go into the database and quickly sort out any data that needs to be pulled for somebody to use.
